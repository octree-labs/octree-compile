\section{Sectio Nulla}
Years ago, I wanted to read some interesting documents. Back then, I traveled to work by bus, then by subway, then by tram, and finally a bit more on foot. Almost 3 hours a day for commute to and from work. It was an opportunity to read a little in peace. But reading A4 prints in a crowded car was out of the question. And then I was handed over for testing one of the first ebook readers in Poland. I decided to take the opportunity and prepared a simple template for pasting texts to convert to PDF file with a format exactly suited to the size of the reader screen and my aesthetic requirements.

\LaTeX{} is a powerhouse!

The proposed composition follows from my views: I believe that on such a small page (6 inches diagonal) you need to cram as much text as possible with the font that is the most comfortable to read.

Therefore, the margins on the screen are minimal (the reader housing serves as a margin), compact line spacing, serif font, clear, similar to Times New Roman. Breaking into syllables, even when it doesn't work perfectly. No page numbers, no head and footer, no embellishments.

Probably not every document will be suitable for use in this template. But I have already used it many, many times, eg. printing various \LaTeX{} manuals.

For reasons unknown to me so far, I have not found (many) similar solutions. Maybe nobody needs it? Anyway, help yourself, maybe someone will come in handy.
