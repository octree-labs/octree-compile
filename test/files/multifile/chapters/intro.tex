\subsection{Introduction Chapter}
This content is loaded from an external file using \texttt{\textbackslash input}.

This demonstrates multi-file compilation where the main document includes content from other files. This is particularly useful for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Large documents with multiple chapters
    \item Collaborative writing
    \item Modular document structure
\end{itemize}

The compiler should handle file paths correctly and resolve all includes.
