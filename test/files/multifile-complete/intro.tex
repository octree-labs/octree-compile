\subsection{Background and Motivation}

This subsection is loaded from an external file (\texttt{intro.tex}) using the \texttt{\textbackslash input} command. This demonstrates that the compiler can correctly resolve file references in the same directory.

\subsubsection{Why Multi-File Documents?}

Multi-file document structures are essential for:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \important{Large Projects}: Breaking down large documents into manageable chunks
    \item \important{Collaboration}: Multiple authors can work on different sections simultaneously
    \item \important{Reusability}: Common sections can be shared across documents
    \item \important{Maintenance}: Easier to update and debug individual sections
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Document Structure}

This test document includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A main file (\texttt{main.tex}) that orchestrates everything
    \item A custom style package (\texttt{mystyle.sty}) with commands and environments
    \item A bibliography file (\texttt{references.bib}) with multiple entries
    \item Multiple section files (\texttt{intro.tex}, \texttt{technical.tex}, \texttt{results.tex})
\end{itemize}

\begin{notebox}
The compilation system must handle all these files correctly, maintaining proper dependencies without subdirectories.
\end{notebox}
